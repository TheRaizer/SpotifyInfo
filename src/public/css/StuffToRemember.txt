For display flex I may want to reset the min-width, as the natural value using flex is min-content, which prevents truncation.

Using #/ID to change styles is marked as more important then anything else, therefore it will override styles done by referencing it by class.

I thought there was a delay when transitioning my flex basis through JS. The reason why was because the flex basis I set was smaller then the actual height of the
so as it would transition from lets say 20px to 70px, you would see a delay as it goes from 20px to 60px because the flex areas actual height was 60px. After the transition
to 60px, you would then see the flex area enlarge to 70px. This caused what seemed like a delay. TO FIX: Use the CSS in the console, and change the transitioning value there. It will
show you how it transitions, and will allow you to set the proper original flex basis before any transitions.
