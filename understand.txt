The animation to smooth flex item wrapping cannot have the initial item moving while the duplicate is being made.
This will cause the duplicate to spawn at the items initial position, which may not be on screen due to the animation/transition.

data-class-to-animate: refers to a class of elements whose animation is triggered through set intervals.

The data-class-to-animate element is passed into the intersection observer where it will wait to be triggered once the user scrolls onto said element. once that happens
The observer will extract the data-class-to-animate attribute which will give it the classes that should be animated in set Intervals.

note to self about async functionality:
    loadPlaylistTracksToHtmlString() explanation:
    This function gets executed synchronously, however it starts an async function that gets playlist tracks.
    However if for example the player decides to click another playlist while the tracks of the previous playlist are still loading
    then clicks back to the playlist they were initially at, if the loading is mistimed then the second playlist they clicked
    will load in instead of the third playlist, which is the initial one. 
    
    To stop this from occuring we make sure to check after loading the tracks whether the loaded tracks come from the correct playlist. 
    If it doesnt then ignore it and dont render them, if it is then render them.

    I do not check if it comes from the right playlist before the tracks are loaded because there is no delay to do so before the tracks start loading.


'cardId' attribute/field in 'Card' and 'Playlist' classes acts as part of an interface, because the 'onCardClick' function in 'cardActions' in index.js assumes that the passed object will have
said field (in a static language 'onCardClick(obj)' would expect any objects with the interface that contains the field 'cardId').
